        I am a current Master Student at ETH Zurich enrolled in the Biomedical Engineering MSc in the Bioelectrionics track. Since highscool, my primary interest has been latent information representation/encoding within the brain,
         although I wouldn't have been able to verbalize it this nicely back then. I believe that the current era of machine learning is facilitating the ideal environment to study this, as it is sheding insight into the mechanistic functinin
         For the first time, mechanisms of the brain are well enough understood to model technology after it in the form of neuromorphic hardware and in silico neural networks. Albeit a thorough understanding of the brain may still be a distant prospect,
          these developments are arguably indicative of a timeframe where technological advancements and discoveries form an environment, enriched enough to cultivate the next zeitgeist, allowing us to conquer one of the greatest frontiers in scientific endeavours of our time

        In my free time I primarily enjoy being out in nature, whether for a bike ride or a hike. I cherish every opportunity to travel and experience new environments and cultures. 
      
        My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality", target="_blank">INTP</a>, which is an acronym for the four constituent categories of the MBTI. In the case of INTP they stand for Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting. Although I do not believe a very percice categroisation of individuality is achieved,
        I do believe that the MBTI enables some insights about oneself. <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/", target="_blank">This questionaire</a> allows you to test your MBTI for free.

        <dd>One major question in neuroscience is how information is represented within the brain. One promising research direction which may proove fruitfull is Neural Manifolds. Neural Manifolds are low-dimensional structures on which neural computation is constrained through the network connectivity.
           One example to clarify this concept is the neural manifold of the head direction cells. Described in a <a href='', target="_blank">paper</a> Professor Ila Fietes group used topological data analysis along with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques in order to establish that the activity of the HD circuit lies on a ring manifold. 
          They then used splines fitted to this manifold to perform unsupervised heading direction estimates by assuming the manifold employs isometric codint, and found exceptional agreement.</dd>

          <dd>Trivially machine learning has taken many inspirations from computational neuroscience. Arguably the field is rooted in the invention of the McCulloch-Pitts Neuron which came the collaboration between a neuroscientist and a logician. Currently, we are entering an era where the discoveries and inspirations are not unilateral anymore.
             This is exemplefied by the paradigm of using Recurrent Neural Networks to mimic neural activity patterns, which then allow for a more holistic analysis of the system. This paradigm is famously applied in the work of <a href="", target="_blank">Mante et al.</a>,
              where they fit an RNN to the neural dynamics of maquace monkeys while perfoming a behaivioural task involving visual integration and selection.   </dd>
